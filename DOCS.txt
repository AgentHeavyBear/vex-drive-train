This is a complete list of all currently implemented functions and what they do, in most cases they do what their single motor equivalent does,
except on the whole drive train.

member functions:

setup:

add_left_motor(pros::Motor *motor) - adds motor pointer to left motor list
add_right_motor(pros::Motor *motor) - adds motor pointer to right motor list

!!!FOR ALL FUNCTIONS WITH OPTIONAL PARAM "which" - sets which motors the function applies to, LEFT, RIGHT, or ALL by default.!!!

movement: 

drive(int speed, std::string which = "") - sets voltage of selected motors from 127 to -127

drive_voltage(int volt, std::string which = "") - sets voltage of selected motors from 12000 to -12000

drive_velocity(int vel, std::string which = "") - sets velocity in RMP of selected motors

drive_relative(double distance, int vel, std::string which = "") - sets relative target position for selected motors to move to

turn(int speed) - sets robot to turn with voltage 127 to -127, positive values turn left

turn_voltage(int volt) - sets robot to turn with voltage 12000 to -12000, positive values turn left

turn_velocity(int vel) - sets robot to turn with RPM, positive values turn left

telemetry:

get_position(std::string which = "") - gets average encoder value of selected motors

tare_position(std::string which = "") - sets the zero position of selected motor's encoder to the current position

get_velocity(std::string which = "") - gets the average velocity of selected motors

is_stopped(std::string which = "") - returns 1 if all selected motors are stopped, and 0 otherwise

get_direction(std::string which = "") - returns 1 if all selected motors are moving forward, -1 if all selected motors are moving backwards, and 0 if any selected motors are moving opposite any other selected motors

get_temperature(std::string which = "") - gets average temperature of selected motors (temp sensors only record to the nearest 5 degrees C)
